# Koa2 Redux Stateless

This is a boilerplate using Koa2 and Redux.  Authentication is fully based on JWTs and thus there is no need for sessions.

## Quickstart

```bash
$ nvm use
$ npm i -g babel-node gulp
$ gulp db:sync
$ gulp dev
```

After a short wait, you'll be able to view the app at http://localhost:9000.  Both the frontend and backend will update in real-time as you make changes.
